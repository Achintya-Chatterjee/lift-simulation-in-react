# Lift Simulation React App 🚀

This project simulates a lift system built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. Users can specify the number of floors and lifts, then simulate the movement of lifts across different floors based on user requests.

## Features

- 🏢 **Dynamic User Inputs**: Easily configure the number of floors (1-100) and lifts (1-10) dynamically.
- 🛗 **Lift Simulation**: Lifts respond to floor requests, moving up or down to the requested floor.
- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly**: Designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring a great experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- 🚀 **Fast Development**: Built with **Vite**, offering fast development builds and hot module replacement (HMR).
- 📦 **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript integration for type safety and better developer experience.
- 🎨 **Styled with Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and customizable UI design.
- ✅ **Testing**: Unit tests included using **Jest** and **React Testing Library** to ensure the app is robust.
