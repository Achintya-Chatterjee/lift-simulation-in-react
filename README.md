# Lift Simulation React App 🚀

This project simulates a lift system built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to specify the number of floors and lifts, then simulate the movement of lifts across floors based on user inputs.

## Features

- 🏢 **Dynamic User Inputs**: Configure the number of floors (1-100) and lifts (1-10) dynamically.
- 🛗 **Lift Simulation**: Lifts move up and down based on the number of floor requests made by users.
- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design with Tailwind CSS to ensure the app looks great on mobile and desktop.
- 🚀 **Fast Development**: Leveraging **Vite** for fast development builds and hot module replacement.
- 📦 **TypeScript Support**: Type-safe development with TypeScript.
- 🎨 **Styled with Tailwind CSS**: Easy, utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- ✅ **Testing**: Unit tests are set up with **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
